Mobile App Dev - App Brainstorming
===

## Recipe Finder App
The recipe finder app would suggest recipes after the user provides their available ingredients. Recipes would be fetched from a public API like *Spoonacular*. Could also allow the user to save their favorite recipes.

Tools: Retrofit, RecyclerView, SQLite.

## Trivia Game
We could use the Open Trivia Database.
The app would fetch trivia questions and display them in a quiz format using RecyclerView. We would provide multiple-choice answers and show results at the end of the quiz.We could add difficulty levels or themes like science, history, etc.

## Random Quote Generator
This app would display motivational or themed quotes with author names. We could add a "favorites" feature to save liked quotes and include a search or filter option by topic or author.

A few APIs that generate quotes. These could possibly be used.

## Pet Care Tracker
The pet care app would creat profiles for your pets to keep vital and dietary information, track vet appointments, upcoming vaccinations, weight tracking, etc

## Weather App
This app would use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. It would display the weekly weather forecast in a RecyclerView. Show temperature, weather condition, and an icon for each day.
Use a search bar to find weather data for a specific city.

## Event Finder
We could use the Ticketmaster API to find events. This app would show upcoming events in a RecyclerView, with titles, locations, and dates. We would add search functionality for events by city or date and include a detail screen with event details and a link to buy tickets.

## Historical events explorer
This app would use the Smithsonian API to display historical events that happened on a given date. We would add filters by category like science, arts, etc. We could also show detailed event descriptions.

## Car info lookup
This app would use the CarMD API for vehicle data or VIN API to display car models, specifications, and maintenance tips. We would add a search feature to find cars by make, model, or year. We could also show diagnostic information for entered VINs.

## Plant care app
This app would use the Trefle API for plant data to display a list of plants with names, images, and care instructions. We would add a search feature to find plants by name or category. We could also include a detail page with watering, sunlight, and soil requirements.

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Recipe Finder
    - **Description:**
The recipe finder app would suggest recipes after the user provides their available ingredients.
    - **Mobile:**
Allows for a more automatic and real-time response to the user's ingredient list. Especially if they just want something real quick in order to decide if they are going to make a provided meal or have to run to the store.
    - **Story:**
Gives users a broader knowledge of recipes, especially those who don’t cook often. It also lessens food waste, it encourages users to use what they have before it goes bad.
    - **Market:**
Anyone who cooks and anyone who doesn’t, it encourages both groups of users to broaden their knowledge and skills in the kitchen.
Anyone who wants a home cooked meal every now and then.
    - **Habit**:
This could be used everyday and for any meal like breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Users can explore many recipes to create and since the recipes are based on their own ingredients they can use it at any time with whatever they have.
    - **Scope:**
Initially the app would take ingredients as an input and then deliver to the user the appropriate recipes. It could also allow the user to save their favorite recipes. In future it could also allow users to leave reviews of the recipes, letting them leave comments. It could hold a separate page where users share how they might have tweaked the recipe to make it their own

2. Trivia Game
    - **Description:**
The app would fetch trivia questions and display them along with multiple-choice answers then show results at the end of the quiz.
    - **Mobile:**
Mobile allows for playing on the go. Whether the user is waiting in a long line or out with friends the game could be played anywhere.
    - **Story:**
Users learn new things as they play, even if they are simple or just fun facts.
    - **Market:**
All ages can play this game. Kids learn more as they play and adults test their own knowledge.
    - **Habit:**
This game could be played at any time of day and it's convenient to pull out and start a game whenever and wherever. Users can play through as many or as little questions as they want.
    - **Scope:**
Initially the app would display questions and multiple-choice answers for the user to select. In a better version we could add levels of difficulty or we could also add themes to sort the questions into like science, history, entertainment, etc.

3. Pet Care Tracker
    - **Mobile:**
Allows the user to access their pets records quickly or on the go. They don’t need to log onto a computer and shuffle through files and folders or look for physical documents if they just want to reference or check the information real quick.
    - **Story:**
This app allows pet owners to be more knowledgeable about their pet. It would almost be like a notes app for pets but tracked by their owners. Users could not only access their pets current health but also keep track of appointments, vaccines, etc.
    - **Market:**
This app would be very beneficial to all pet owners. It gives them the ability to keep constant track of their pets' health and activities.
    - **Habit:**
This app ideally would not be accessed too much in case of healthy pets except for when vaccines need to be renewed or checkups are scheduled. However this app could be used daily in the event the pet needs to be monitored for illness, weight tracking, and unusual behaviors.
    - **Scope:**
This app would create a user profile for your pet to store a collection of personal information for that pet. The homepage would display quick information including time, date, and upcoming/past due events.
